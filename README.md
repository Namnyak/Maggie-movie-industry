# Project Title
MOVIE INDUSTRY ANALYSIS:
Analyzing Box Office Trends to Inform Film Production Decisions

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide strategic insights for a new movie studio aiming to succeed in the competitive film industry. By examining key factors such as production budgets, box office revenues, genre performance, and audience ratings, the analysis identifies trends and patterns that can guide the studio in making informed decisions about film production. The goal is to understand what types of films perform best at the box office and how various elements like budget allocation, genre selection, and market strategies influence a film's success. These insights will help the studio optimize its investments, maximize profitability, and cater to audience preferences effectively.

By understanding the key factors that contribute to a film's success, we can make informed decisions about the genres, themes, and target audiences that will maximize our chances of producing commercially successful films.

## Data Understanding and Analysis
The data for this analysis is sourced from three online movie databases:

Box Office Mojo
Provides detailed box office revenue data for films.

Internet Movie Database (IMDb)
IMDb is a comprehensive online database offering movie information, statistics, and user ratings. The dataset comprises multiple tables, and for this analysis, two tables were used: one with basic movie data and another with user ratings. The key data points include the release date, runtime (in minutes), and average rating. Contains information on genres, cast, crew, ratings, and review

The Movie Database (TMDB)
TMDB is a user-generated database containing detailed information about movies and user ratings. The dataset includes 26,517 entries and 9 data columns. The key data points are the release date and genre, with genre codes sorted by relevance.

The Numbers (TN)
The TN dataset provides box office information for 5,782 movies. The key data points include the release date, production budget, and worldwide gross revenue.

## Data Visualization



## Conclusion
Focus on High-Grossing Genres and Studios:
Prioritize genres and movie types that have historically performed well in terms of worldwide gross revenue. According to our findings, studios like BV (Buena Vista) and Universal (Uni) have produced some of the highest-grossing movies, including 'Avengers: Infinity War,' 'Jurassic World,' and 'Furious 7.'

Balance Between Production Budget and ROI:
While aiming for high worldwide gross revenue, it is also essential to manage production budgets effectively to ensure a strong return on investment (ROI). Set realistic budgets for productions while maintaining high-quality standards.

Movies like 'Frozen' and 'Furious 7' demonstrated significant profitability with ROIs of 7.48 and 6.99, respectively. Carefully evaluate potential projects to balance production costs and expected revenue

Leverage Viewer Preferences in Genres and Runtimes:
Cater to viewer preferences for both high-rated genres and suitable runtimes. Genres such as short films, documentaries, and biographical content have high average ratings.

Diversify our film portfolio to include a mix of genre types. While blockbuster action and adventure films can drive high revenue, incorporating highly-rated genres like documentaries and short films can enhance our brand reputation and attract diverse audiences.

Target Both Domestic and International Markets:
Plan for a balanced approach to earning revenue from both domestic and foreign markets. Our analysis shows that successful movies have substantial earnings from international audiences.

Develop marketing strategies tailored to different regions, leveraging cultural trends and preferences. Consider international partnerships for co-productions to enhance global appeal.
